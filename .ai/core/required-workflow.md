# Required Workflow

## Phase 1 - Analyze The Existing System; Do Not Edit Code

0. Run the Repository Intelligence Gate. If CodeGraph or CocoIndex is unavailable, continue in `DEGRADED` mode using bounded native repository evidence and record the limitation.
1. Restate the business outcome and exact problem to solve.
2. Query CodeGraph for structural location and impact when ready, then query CocoIndex for related code, requirements, specifications, tests, and documentation when ready. Use `rg --files`, `rg`, targeted reads, Git history, diagnostics, and tests for unavailable evidence.
3. Inspect only the most relevant code, functions, tests, configuration, documentation, specifications, diagrams, recent related changes, and linked work item sections returned by indexed evidence.
4. Trace the real current execution path end to end, including callers, downstream consumers, persistence, integrations, error paths, retries, and operational behavior.
5. Separate indexed facts, source-code verified facts, assumptions, unknowns, and hypotheses.
6. Identify the first incorrect state or precise capability gap.
7. Identify impacted modules, classes, functions, APIs, events, schemas, configuration, data, dependencies, jobs, users, operators, and environments.
8. Determine what existing behavior must remain unchanged.
9. Classify risk and identify regression-sensitive areas.
10. Detect language/version/framework/tooling and select matching `.ai/quality-profiles/` under `.ai/core/code-quality-intelligence.md`.
10a. When UI, UX, localization, accessibility text, or displayed-data meaning is in scope, inventory every changed user-facing string and applicable state, then apply the mandatory `write-product-content` skill with `.ai/quality-profiles/product-content.yaml`. Map `Purpose`, `Agency`, `Responsibility`, `Familiarity`, `Flexibility`, `Simplicity`, `Craft`, and `Delight`, identify target-platform conventions, and block rather than skip a required principle.
11. Propose the smallest safe change that addresses only the issue or approved requirement.
12. Identify tests, validation evidence, documentation, specification, diagram, runbook, ADR, API-contract, Jira, deployment, and rollback impacts.
13. Run the Agent Department orchestration decision. Reuse the shared brief and select the smallest safe team; unsupported subagents fall back to serial personas.

## Phase 2 - Produce A Reviewable Change-Impact And Implementation Plan

Before editing protected existing-system files, produce a plan containing:

```text
Problem statement and business outcome
Current behavior and verified execution flow
Root cause or capability gap
In-scope behavior
Explicit out-of-scope behavior
Proposed solution
Alternative options considered and trade-offs
Exact files/modules/classes/functions expected to change
Change area boundary
Impact boundary
Files explicitly approved for change
Areas requiring developer review before touching
Reason no other area is changed
Change details for each file/function
Callers, consumers, contracts, data, and integrations affected
Existing behavior that must be preserved
Security, privacy, transaction, concurrency, and data-integrity impact
Performance and capacity impact
Backward-compatibility impact
Failure, timeout, retry, and rollback behavior
Test and regression strategy
Detected language/version/tooling and selected quality profiles
Documentation/specification/diagram updates
Deployment or migration steps
Known assumptions, unknowns, and risks
Approval decision requested
```

Stop after presenting the plan. Do not implement until explicit approval evidence exists.

## Phase 3 - Implement Within Approved Scope

1. Confirm repository evidence is sufficient for the task risk before editing protected files. `DEGRADED` tooling status alone does not block approved work.
2. Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly changed.
3. Follow established repository patterns.
4. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
5. Stay within the approved plan and constraints.
6. Stop for a delta-impact plan and renewed approval if material scope or design changes emerge.
6a. Execute approved work through the planned workcell. Claim assignments through the versioned shared context, publish structured evidence handoffs, keep one write owner, and preserve independent review ownership.
7. Use explicit error handling.
8. Protect authentication, authorization, sensitive data, and transaction integrity.
9. Add tests that demonstrate expected behavior when feasible.
10. Add or update operational telemetry where behavior is production-significant.
11. Keep changes reviewable and reversible.
12. For user-facing text or displayed data, keep wording bound to verified behavior and business meaning; cover applicable loading, empty, error, success, permission, stale, partial, and destructive states; do not defer product language until after implementation.

## Phase 4 - Complete With Evidence And Traceability

1. Run relevant build, unit, integration, static-analysis, and formatting checks.
2. Verify acceptance criteria.
3. Complete the quality gates in `.ai/core/quality-gates.md` with status and evidence.
4. Complete `.ai/templates/code-quality-review.md` using matching `.ai/quality-profiles/`.
5. Review security and data implications.
6. Review performance and concurrency implications.
7. Check compatibility and migration requirements.
8. Update authoritative documentation, specifications, and diagrams or provide a specific no-change rationale.
9. Query available indexes for changed-symbol impact and refresh CodeGraph/CocoIndex indexes when available. If unavailable, use native evidence and record the limitation.
10. Re-run the Repository Intelligence Gate and compare actual diff to approved scope; `DEGRADED` is acceptable when evidence remains sufficient.
10a. For any changed user-facing text or displayed-data semantics, complete `.ai/templates/product-content-review.md`, including all eight mandatory Human Interface principles and target-platform fit; a string-file review, generic Apple-like claim, or missing principle status cannot pass the Product Language Gate.
11. Prepare PR/MR evidence when requested or when a change is ready for review.
12. Prepare a Jira completion package when the task is tied to a work item.
13. Identify any reusable Memory candidates under `.ai/core/memory-policy.md`, or state `None`.
14. Describe deployment sequencing.
15. Describe rollback.
16. Report commands executed and actual results.
17. Run `final-implementation-review` against the completed diff. Review requirement match, security, code quality, bad paths, error handling, production readiness, and trade-offs; fix approved in-scope findings, re-run affected checks, and review the complete diff again. Repeat until a fresh review passes.
18. Record every review cycle and preserve findings and fixes. Do not emit a successful final response while the newest review is missing, stale, rejected, or blocked. Stop with a precise blocker only when further progress requires new scope, authority, or external evidence.
19. Clearly identify anything not executed or not verified.
