# Repository Intelligence Workflow

Use this workflow before brainstorming, planning, impact analysis, code review, QA analysis, documentation analysis, or implementation.

1. Run `.ai/scripts/check-repository-intelligence.py`.
2. If indexes are stale, attempt `.ai/scripts/refresh-repository-index.py` once, then re-run the gate.
3. If the gate is `DEGRADED`, continue with bounded native evidence: `rg --files`, `rg`, targeted source/document reads, Git history, compiler or language-server diagnostics, and relevant tests. Record which index evidence is unavailable.
4. When ready, query CodeGraph first for structural location, entry points, symbols, callers, callees, dependency paths, and impact areas.
5. When ready, query CocoIndex second for semantic matches, requirements, specs, docs, runbooks, ADRs, tests, contracts, and similar implementations.
6. Open only the highest-value paths and exact sections returned by those indexes.
7. Verify critical conclusions against the actual source code.
8. Record a shared repository intelligence brief using `.ai/templates/repository-intelligence-brief.md`.
9. Reuse the brief across specialist agents; subagents query indexes only for role-specific gaps.
10. During brainstorming, distinguish indexed facts, source-code verified facts, assumptions, unknowns, alternatives, smallest safe solution, long-term solution, regression risks, and recommended direction.
11. Before implementation, identify exact files/classes/functions, direct and indirect callers, API/event/database/config dependencies, tests, and preserved behavior.
12. After implementation, compare actual diff to approved scope. Query and refresh available indexes; if either remains unavailable, verify with native evidence and report the limitation.

Do not silently substitute one index for the other. In degraded mode, explicitly name the fallback evidence used. Source code and executable verification remain authoritative for critical behavior.
