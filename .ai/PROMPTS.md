# AI Agent Prompt Catalog

Use these copy-ready prompts after running bootstrap. Pick the prompt by the work you are doing, paste the ticket or context, and let the agent follow the shared `.ai/` policy.

## Quick Start

Install the kit in a repository:

```bash
npx --yes @hunpeolabs/ai-agent-kit@latest bootstrap --yes
```

List prompt names any time:

```bash
npx --yes @hunpeolabs/ai-agent-kit@latest prompts
```

Print one prompt:

```bash
npx --yes @hunpeolabs/ai-agent-kit@latest prompt start-task
```

## Prompt Names

| Name | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `start-task` | A ticket or request is new, broad, risky, or unclear. |
| `plan-change` | Existing behavior may change and implementation must stop before approval. |
| `implement-approved` | A reviewed plan is approved and the agent may edit inside that scope. |
| `fix-bug` | A defect needs root cause, first incorrect state, and regression coverage. |
| `code-quality-review` | A change, file, module, or PR needs stack-aware quality review. |
| `review-pr` | A diff, branch, PR, or MR needs senior engineering review. |
| `investigate-incident` | A production issue needs timeline, impact, evidence, mitigation, and prevention. |
| `prepare-handoff` | Work is ready for PR/MR, Jira, validation, quality gates, and memory-candidate handoff. |
| `build-seo-geo-website` | A public website needs an evidence-based SEO/GEO plan, implementation, or audit. |
| `design-website` | A website or product surface needs design direction, approved implementation, audit-first redesign, or visual review. |
| `animate-interface` | A user interface needs animation opportunities, motion direction, approved implementation, strict review, or an improvement inventory. |
| `design-system` | Product constraints need a measurable system architecture, capacity model, security boundaries, staged scale, and cost range. |

## design-system

```text
Use the design-scalable-systems skill for this request.

Requirement:
[describe the product, workload, latency, users or connections, reliability, security, data, cost, region, and delivery constraints you know]

Inspect the repository first. Normalize the request, ask no more than three architecture-changing questions, and continue with explicit scenarios when answers are unavailable.

Return:
- one recommended architecture and why
- measurable requirements with source and confidence
- assumptions, contradictions, and unknowns
- one clear architecture diagram and request/data flow
- deterministic capacity and bandwidth calculations
- launch, target, and justified extreme-scale cost scenarios
- overload, dependency, recovery, data, and security boundaries
- evolution triggers and migration path
- benchmark, load, resilience, recovery, security, cost, and observability validation plan
- READY_FOR_REVIEW, NEEDS_DECISION, INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE, or CONSTRAINTS_CONFLICT

Never invent per-instance throughput, cloud prices, discounts, compliance, or production evidence. Do not provision, deploy, run paid tests, commit, push, or release without separate approval.
```

Do not promise indexing, canonical selection, rankings, rich results, crawler compliance, traffic, conversions, revenue, AI visibility, or citations.

In plan or audit mode, do not edit website files. In implement mode, require approval evidence and remain inside approved scope.
```

## design-website

```text
Use the design-taste-website skill.

Mode:
[direction | implement | redesign | review]

Surface and scope:
[describe the website, product UI, routes, screens, components, or approved redesign boundary]

Audience, goal, and constraints:
[provide audience, user task, business outcome, existing brand/design system, references, content, supported viewports/locales, accessibility, compliance, and performance constraints]

Return:
- repository intelligence gate status
- surface classification, audience, primary task, and business outcome
- one-sentence Design Read
- contextual layout variance, motion intensity, and information density with rationale
- existing design-system and brand evidence
- primary inspiration and optional secondary influence, with copy boundaries
- design principles, anti-goals, tokens, typography, color, spacing, layout, imagery, icons, shape, elevation, and motion direction
- responsive composition
- applicable default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, empty, error, success, offline, unauthorized, stale, and partial states
- accessibility, reduced-motion, performance, content, SEO/GEO, and asset-rights boundaries
- evidence classified as repository-verified, screenshot-observed, browser-measured, reference-derived, inferred, unavailable, or not applicable
- visual QA plan or prioritized findings

Use project-owned design guidance before external inspiration. Do not hard-code a framework, font, icon library, or animation library. Do not copy protected brand material or fabricate trust signals.

In direction and review modes, do not edit application files. Redesign is audit-first. Implement only with approval evidence and remain inside approved scope.
```

## animate-interface

```text

Mode:
[opportunities | direction | implement | review | improve]

Surface and scope:
[describe the route, component, flow, diff, codebase area, or approved animation boundary]

Motion context:
[provide audience, task, frequency, approved motion intensity, existing motion system, supported browsers/devices/inputs, accessibility target, performance budget, and constraints]

Return:
- repository intelligence gate status
- current motion inventory or explicit no-animation baseline
- animation decision: should it animate, purpose, frequency, trigger, and essential/decorative status
- motion vocabulary, tokens, timing, enter/exit, origin, stagger, and spatial-continuity direction where applicable
- repeated, interrupted, reversed, canceled, route-change, background-tab, and unmount behavior
- gesture bounds, pointer capture, velocity, damping, multi-touch, and input parity where applicable
- static and reduced-motion behavior
- layout, paint, composite, main-thread, input, memory, layer, battery, and lifecycle review
- browser/API compatibility, fallback, and dependency impact
- evidence classified as source-verified, browser-observed, trace-measured, device-observed, inferred, unavailable, or not applicable
- prioritized findings, approved implementation result, or verification plan

Do not add motion without a purpose. Do not hard-code a universal duration, easing, spring, scale, or library. Do not claim smoothness, frame rate, hardware acceleration, accessibility, or negligible performance impact without evidence.

Opportunities, direction, review, and improve modes are read-only. Implement only with approval evidence and remain inside approved scope.
